Question 11:
We have a product, say a pen. For each day of the year create a record of for sales of pens.
The record will have the units sold, the price, and the amount (units*price). The price and the
units would be random numbers within the range. The price can be between 20 and 30. The
units can be between 100 - 1000. But the price will remain the same for each month. Once the
data is created compute and output the following.
